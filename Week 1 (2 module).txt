Introduction to Importing Data in ServiceNow

Series Overview

The series will cover the standard data import process in ServiceNow
Topics to be covered:
Data sources
Import sets
Transform Maps
Field Maps
Data import scheduling
Terminology

Source data entity: stores the data to be imported
Target data entity: where the data will be loaded
Staging table (also referred to as Import Set table in ServiceNow): an intermediary table between the source and target entities
Key Points

ServiceNow introduces an intermediary table (staging table) between the source and target entities
The staging table is automatically created by ServiceNow when the import process is initiated
The import process involves three data entities: source, staging table, and target


A data source is a record in a table in ServiceNow that stores the parameters needed to understand the type of source data entity.
The data source table is named CIS_data_source.
To create a data source, navigate to System Import Sets > Administration > Data Sources.
Fill out the required fields, including:
Name: a descriptive name for the data source.
Type: the type of data source (e.g. file, JDBC, LDAP, OIDC, custom script).
Label: a label for the staging table that will be created.
Name: the actual name of the staging table.
Depending on the type of data source, additional fields may be required, such as:
JDBC: database type, server name, port, username, password, and SQL statement.
File: file format (e.g. CSV, Excel, JSON, XML), file retrieval method (e.g. attachment, FTP).
Once the data source is created, attach the file or configure the connection to the data source.
ServiceNow will use the header row of the data source to create fields in the staging table.


Importing Data into ServiceNow

Created a data source record in the previous note
Data source record is used by ServiceNow to understand the source of the data
Parameters for the creation of the staging table are set in the data source record
Staging Table (Import Set Table)

ServiceNow automatically creates the staging table as part of the import process
The staging table is created based on the parameters set in the data source record
The table name is prefixed with "u_" and the label is set to "Test Import"
Loading Data into the Staging Table

Ran an import to load data from the Excel file into the staging table
ServiceNow checks if the staging table exists, and if not, creates it based on the parameters set in the data source record
The data is then loaded into the staging table
Viewing the Staging Table

Used the dot list command to view the contents of the staging table
The staging table has five rows, which are the same as the rows in the Excel file
Import Set Table

ServiceNow provides an out-of-the-box table called sys_import_set to manage the data loaded into the staging table
Each record in the import set table represents a group or set of records inserted into the staging table
The import set table is used to track the import runs and the records loaded into the staging table
Managing Import Runs

ServiceNow allows you to manage the records loaded into the staging table based on the import run
Each import run is assigned a unique number, and the records loaded into the staging table are linked to the import run
This allows you to track which records were loaded in each import run

The video is a tutorial on ServiceNow Incident Management and Task Administration.
The speaker, Jeff Teist, explains that the task table is one of the core components of ServiceNow's platform and that management is one of its primary functions.
He introduces the concept of hierarchical database design, where tables are created as extensions or children of the task table, inheriting its common attributes and adding their own.
He mentions that there are three commonly used types of tasks in ServiceNow: change request, incident, and problem.
He explains how tasks are assigned to users or groups by populating the "assigned to" and "assignment group" fields, and how the user and group tables need to be populated first.
He introduces the concept of assignment rules, which are records in the database that tell the platform how to automatically populate the "assign to" and "assignment group" fields when tasks are created.
He demonstrates how to create a new assignment rule, using the example of assigning all hardware incidents to the hardware support group and the user Abraham Lincoln.
He also mentions the existence of assignment lookup rules, which are less powerful than assignment rules and can only be created against incident tasks.
He explains how users can access tasks assigned to themselves or a group they belong to using the service desk application.
He introduces the concept of user presence and real-time editing, which allow multiple stakeholders to view and update records simultaneously.
He demonstrates how the active viewer icon and real-time editing pulse icon work, using the example of two users viewing and editing the same incident record.
He mentions the importance of activity entries and worknotes in facilitating teamwork and communication.
He briefly introduces visual task boards, which provide a more graphical drag and drop Paradigm for viewing tasks, and demonstrates how to create and use them.

Jeff Tease is a software developer and technical architect with 30+ years of experience. He has been working exclusively with ServiceNow and created the YouTube channel "ServiceNow Simple" to teach people about ServiceNow in a simple and fun way.
In this tutorial, Jeff will discuss the data model that supports ServiceNow's reporting functionality.
The main table that supports reporting is the sys_report table, which stores a record for each report in the instance.
Other tables that support reporting capabilities include:
sys_report_source: Allows storing and reusing saved queries for retrieving data from source tables and populating a report.
sys_email_report_schedule: Provides the ability to set up a report to execute automatically on a recurring basis and have it emailed to interested users.
sys_report_user_group: Allows sharing reports directly with individual users or groups of users via the UI.
The sys_report table has 156 fields that describe how the report should behave. Some of the most commonly used fields are:
sys_id: The system-generated unique ID of any record.
title: The title of the report.
source_type: Specifies where the platform should go for the data (table or data source).
source: The counterpart to the source_type field.
table: The primary database table from which the report data is pulled.
field_name: The field within the table that the data should be grouped on for presentation purposes.
filter: Tells the platform about any filtering conditions to apply to narrow down the data being included in the report.
type: Specifies which type of report or visualization the platform should use when presenting the report data.
ServiceNow provides over 23 different types of reports or visualizations out of the box, including lists, Box, Bar, pivots, Trends, line, control, spline, area, histogram, heat map, map, maps, calendars, bubble, funnel, pyramid, Donuts, pie, speedometer, and single score.
To create a new report, you can use the Reports application's "Create New" module, ServiceNow Studio, or create a new report from an existing list view.
When creating a new report, you will need to populate fields such as the report name, source type, table, and group by field.


Introduction:

The show is about low code no code development, brought to you by ServiceNow.
The host introduces the cast of characters: Savvy Business Person, IT Superstar, and The Wall (the barrier between business and IT).
The Story:

The Savvy Business Person has an idea for digital transformation, but needs IT support.
The IT Superstar receives the requirements and creates a system design, but the Savvy Business Person is not satisfied with the result.
The cycle of feedback and iteration begins, with the IT Superstar making changes and the Savvy Business Person providing feedback.
The process is slow and frustrating, with the Wall (the barrier between business and IT) causing delays and miscommunication.
The Problem:

The traditional software development process is slow, costly, and frustrating.
The IT Superstar is skilled, but the process is inefficient.
The Solution:

Low code no code development is introduced as a solution to break down the barriers between business and IT.
Low code no code tools empower Savvy Business People to solve business problems themselves, without needing extensive IT knowledge.
Examples of low code no code tools include ServiceNow's App Engine Studio, Now Experience UI Builder, and Flow Designer.
Benefits:

Improved agility and speed to market
Lower costs
Increased automation
Challenges:

Low code no code tools may not be flexible or customizable enough for complex tasks.
The code is still there, just hidden from view.
Opportunities:

Savvy Business People can learn technical skills and take control of their work.
IT Superstars can focus on supporting the business, rather than just coding.
